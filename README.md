This repository contains the dataset of politicians' Twitter handles we have compiled for India and the United States. These handles were collected as a part of the [NivaDuck](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3400806.3400830) project. Please cite the paper from the link above if you plan to use the data in publications.
